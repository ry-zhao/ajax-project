# KitchenGod.io

A web application for people who want to search for, save, and edit recipes.

I wanted to build this app to simplify the process of finding recipes online.
All too often users will search for recipes online and find themselves sifting
through paragraphs of irrelevant backstories behind the recipes when what they want
is a list of ingredients and instructions. The intention behind KitchenGod.io was
to cut out the noise and provide the user with recipes only.
